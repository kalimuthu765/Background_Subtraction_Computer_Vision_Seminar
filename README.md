# Background Subtraction in Computer Vision

## Overview

This project explores **Background Subtraction**, a fundamental technique in Computer Vision used to separate moving objects (foreground) from static scenes (background) in videos or image sequences. It is widely applied in surveillance, traffic monitoring, and human activity recognition.

This seminar aims to:
- Explain the concept of background subtraction.
- Demonstrate popular background subtraction algorithms.
- Compare their performance on sample video data.
